# Autopilot

## Description
A basic 2D simulation program in Java that replicates the functionality of Tesla Autopilot.

## Features

### 1. Lane Keeping
The simulation includes a lane-keeping feature, demonstrating the autonomous ability of the vehicle to stay within designated lanes. This showcases a fundamental aspect of self-driving technology where the car autonomously follows the road's trajectory.

### 2. Obstacle Detection
Basic obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities are simulated in the program. The vehicle responds to obstacles in its path, adjusting its trajectory to avoid collisions. This feature highlights the importance of sensors and perception in autonomous driving systems.

### 3. Speed Control
The simulation incorporates adaptive cruise control, allowing the vehicle to adjust its speed based on the surrounding environment. This showcases the ability of autonomous vehicles to maintain a safe and adaptive speed while navigating through different scenarios.

## Installation
To run the Tesla Autopilot Simulation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the file in an IDE that supports Java.
3. Run the main program.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the features and functionalities of the Tesla Autopilot Simulation are welcome.
